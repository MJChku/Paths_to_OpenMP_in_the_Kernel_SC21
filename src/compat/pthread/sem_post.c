 *      This function posts a wakeup to a semaphore.
 *
 * PARAMETERS
 *      sem
 *              pointer to an instance of sem_t
 *
 * DESCRIPTION
 *      This function posts a wakeup to a semaphore. If there
 *      are waiting threads (or processes), one is awakened;
 *      otherwise, the semaphore value is incremented by one.
 *
 * RESULTS
 *              0               successfully posted semaphore,
 *              -1              failed, error in errno
 * ERRNO
 *              EINVAL          'sem' is not a valid semaphore,
 *              ENOSYS          semaphores are not supported,
 *              ERANGE          semaphore count is too big
